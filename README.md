### CS169 Spring 2012
# Inner City Advisors

The needs of the organization in terms of the web-based software project can be summarized in three main features:

1. a global contact list that can be easily filtered by certain constraints and, after filtering, be exportable in such a way that ICA would not have to send messages to all members of their contact list when attempting to contact just a subset of the list.

2. an easily manageable, centralized location to view statuses and detailed information about clients, namely contact info, details of conversations between the client and ICA representatives, information on where in the ICA stack of processes has the client been (e.g. has the client been introduced to ICA's purposes and goals? has the client been informed of the events hosted by ICA that may serve to meet their needs? has the client's portfolio been started or established? has the client been introduced to a potential list of advisors? etc.)

3. a permission-restricted page per client with information entered by individual advisors based on their own communications, where an advisor has permissions to only edit their potential client's page to summarize what they discussed and what they consider to be the items they can offer if they were to become partners with the client.
